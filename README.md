# Event Service Web App (Vue 3)

This project demonstrates building a web application for managing events using **Vue.js 3** and related technologies. It was developed as part of the "Real World Vue" course from Vue Mastery ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/Code-Pop/real-world-vue)). 

## Features

*   **Event Management:**
    *   Create new events with form validation.
    *   List all events.
    *   View individual event details.
*   **State Management:** Utilizes **Vuex 4** for efficient state management with modules, actions, mutations, and getters.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Modern UI/UX.
    *   Form validation with **VeeValidate 4**. 
*   **Code Quality:**
    *   Uses `ESLint` and `Prettier` for consistent code style and error checking.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Vue.js 3** 
    *   **Vue Router 4**
    *   **Vuex 4**
    *   **Axios** 
    *   **VeeValidate 4** 
*   **Development Tools:**
